# Fast-Food-Marketing-Campaign
Objective :To help the company choose the best promotion based on a number of promotion strategies

# Introduction:



A fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.



## How promotion affects the sales of a market based on its size (that is how same size market works in different promotion channel)

From the above graph , we find out there is promotion_2 performs least of three.

While there remains doubt in case of promotion_1 and promotion_3. To get more evidence we will test it through the hypothesis test:

Ho : THere is no difference between salesinthoushand between promotion_1 and promotion_3.

Ha: There is a significance difference between sales_in_thousand between promotion_1 and promotion_3.

From the hypothesis testing,  it was found that promotion 2 works worst for all size of markets. While there appears to be no difference in average sales from promotion 1 and promotion 3.

Now,we will dive further, like week wise promotion impact on sales.

From the above, we can see that there are more number of firms that are new. (mainly below 10 years)

The promotion_2 performs worst for all location categories. Whereas, promotion 1 performs best.

# Conclusion:


Based on the above analysis, we have found the following insights:

The promotion_2 yields least amount of benefits(or sales on average) to the firms irrespective of location, age, week, or size.

It was found that promotion_1 and promotion_3 have been close on their impact on sales ,although promotion_1 generated a higher average sales but it was only marginal, when compared on the basis of marketsize, week, age of store. The same was being assured from the evidence provided by A/B tests that shows lack of a significant difference in sales for marketsize, week, and age.

On the contrary, there was an outlier in case of location where promotion_1 generated the relatively higher average sales to the firms.
Hence, the firm can make use of either promotion_1 or promotion_3. Since, promotion_1 performs significantly better in case of location and it has a higher average sales in case of age , weeek and age, promotion_1 would help in optimizing the business revenue.
